      <p>
        This excludes data from Blueprint, which was not an overnight hackathon.
      </p>
      <p>
        Note how the majority of tickets are submitted between the hours of 3-10pm.

      <h2>
        Mean Response Time By Hour (Overall)
      </h2>
      <canvas id="responsexhour-all" width="1000" height="400"></canvas>
      <p>
        In minutes. <i> Lower is better! </i>
      </p>
      <p>
        This excludes tickets with a response time > 1 hour
      </p>
      <p>
        Response time increases dramatically between the hours of 2am-8am, while many mentors leave. A sizeable number of tickets are still submitted during this time.

        Quality over Time (Overall)

      <p>
        Interestingly, mentor ratings dip from 2-3:59am, but rise again!

        Which topics were answered the fastest? The slowest?

      </div>

      <div class="clearfix"></div>

      <p>
        Interestingly, the topics people need the most help with are also the topics with the longest wait times. Android and parse help is highly demanded but also comes with some of the longest wait times!
      </p>

      <h3>
        What about <i>sets</i> of topics?
      </h3>

      <p>
        Taking the 100 most common topics, we can build sets of words where people need help with multiple topics in the same ticket.
